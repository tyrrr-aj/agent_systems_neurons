# Neural system simulation
## Agent systems project

# Setup
In order to run and edit this project, one needs to:
1. Clone this repo
2. Download necessary libraries ([MASON](https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/) and dependecies) as .jar files from [here](https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/mason.20.jar) and [here](https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/libraries.zip)
3. Add those libraries to project manually (at least some of them are not available in dependency management repositories). In IntelliJ:
    1. Open Project settings (Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S)
    2. Navigate to Module->Dependencies
    3. Choose Add Dependecy (+) -> External JAR or library...
    4. Select all .jars downloaded before
4. Install Java 3D 
   1. Download [Java 3D](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-archive-downloads-java-client-downloads.html#java3d-1.5.1-oth-JPR) 
   2. Add jars from ...\Java3D\1.5.1\lib\ext to project manually (sane as above)
